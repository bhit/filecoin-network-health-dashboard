## About Starboard:
With the growing adoption of Web3 data services such as blockchain, smart contracts, NFT, and decentralized data storage and retrieval, economic networks around Web3 data and data services are emerging quickly. 

However, the rapid development of such economic networks often leads to increasing complexities, making it difficult for network participants and stakeholders to understand the networks and make well-informed decisions.

Starboard aims to close the above mentioned gaps and empower the success of Web3 data economies through research, insights, and product incubation. Starboard is a dedicated contributor to the Filecoin Network, which is the largest Web3 data economy in the world.
